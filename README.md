# Five-Forty

Five Forty is a creative website themed around the hour 5:40 am. It is the first issue of online magazine synthetic velvet I founded in 2018.

synthetic velvet is a creative project that imaginatively explores the concept of time. Each issue is themed around one specific hour and takes the form of a website. The project launched with this issue, Five Forty, themed on 5:40 am. It features creative works, all inspired by this time.

My role involved designing and developing the website as well as coordinating its production. 6 artists created creative content: Camila Ayala, Helene Belaunde, Audrey Kadjar, Linhui Li, Gulce Masrabaci, Eduardo Taborda

Since launching, synthetic velvet has been exhibited as a part of the Vorspiel program organized by digital culture festivals CTM and Transmediale as well as in the [VABF exhibition in Vancouver](http://vancouverartbookfair.com/19/about/).
