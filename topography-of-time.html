      <h1 class="title_topography">Morning</h1>
      <p class="paragraph_topography">
        Prior to the break of day, the earth resembles outer space. First, it is
        silent. It’s a kind of silence that triggers a sense of vitality rather
        than thought. The body becomes much more palpable with its parts and
        functions: you have a skin, a head, feet, respiration. Then, it is dark.
        Without sunlight, the visibility range extends further into the space,
        and you see other luminous bodies, such as the stars. It is also cold,
        so that when you step out into the fresh air, you don’t want to sleep
        anymore, you are awake. <br /><br />

        At 5:40 on the island of Patmos, all three of my fellow travelers are
        sleeping. Their rooms, with open doors, merge to a vast balcony that
        protrudes from a hill. I am there. Barely a few minutes ago I was also
        sleeping, tucked under a giant blanket in infinite comfort. But the
        determination I feel now, and the wait for the sunrise, an almost
        journalistic wait, is better.
        <br /><br />

        Often, when I am awake to see the sunrise, I actually don’t see the sun
        rising. Morning often comes with a series of incremental changes of
        color, which escape observation, but which I am trying to observe now.
        For example: red slits appear in the sky. Widening, they form screens in
        the foreground, in which you could watch clouds pass at a depth. The
        clouds move as slowly as, and look like, camels. Initially, everything
        seems to be done with pencil dust; but soon colors claim boundaries and
        intensify. Of all the preceding obscurity, green emerges with such
        brightness that it becomes impossible to mistake for another color. But
        it is orange, for some reason, that is reflected on the sea. An
        ephemeral win in the competition with blue, which is eternally reflected
        on all seas.<br /><br />

        The sun moves, and morning finds a different longitude. It is an
        occurrence that comes once a day only as observed from our vantage
        point, but morning itself is continuous. <br /><br />

        And then there are other mornings, concurrently taking place by the rise
        of other suns over other sets of planets. Cycles of light and darkness
        alternate around countless spheres, which themselves circle gigantic
        orbs distributed in the vast texture of the universe. Without halt they
        spin and whirl in a hardworking order like the insides of a mechanical
        watch.<br /><br />

        It is a day, again.<br />

      <h1 class="title_topography">Dreams vs. Days</h1>
      <p class="paragraph_topography">
        If you’ve ever tried to write down or remember your dreams, you must
        have noticed that dreams dissipate with the day. It is other words,
        especially, that break them apart: to hold a dream you must neither
        speak about nor hear anything else, and nor should you read. Just like a
        night’s dreams, dreams of life are often diluted by the unsculpted body
        of the everyday until they have no density of their own. Here we have
        our first rift.
      </p>

      <img src="images/topography/3.png" alt="image_topographyoftime" />
      <h1 class="title_topography">Literature vs. Data Analysis</h1>
      <p class="paragraph_topography">
        Although all evidence points to the contrary, I actually don’t like to
        think in dichotomies. But placing my job as a data analyst side by side
        with my dream to become a novelist, I can’t help but conclude that they
        are, in many ways, fundamentally contradictory to each other.
        <br /><br />
        It is not only that data analysis is a defining tool of our times and
        novel-writing essentially a 19th century craft; consider above all how
        these two things approach complexity. Data analysis starts out from a
        plethora of complexity and tries to reduce it into simplicity, and
        that’s how it makes sense of things. Literature, on the other hand,
        escalates the complexity even further by unfolding the pleats of life.
        It adds yet another character; yet another story; yet another world to
        ours. It shows every minute detail; it opens up, up, up, until we have
        splinters so small, they can serve as the building blocks of a bigger
        thing. A bigger thing which we have known, we have felt, perhaps even
        lived through, but haven’t been paying attention to; literature gives it
        shape and expands it into a defined universal truth, and that’s how it
        makes sense of things. <br /><br />
        Their tolerance to complexity governs their approach to time. Data
        analysis is always in a hurry to compute, whipping time’s back, while
        literature has a richness and warmth that makes time malleable, where
        you can write a hundred pages over a period of months to describe two or
        three minutes. They embody such different spirits; yet there they are,
        both of them, in my life.
      </p>

      <img src="images/topography/4.jpg" alt="image_topographyoftime" />
      <h1 class="title_topography">Kronos and Kairos</h1>
      <p class="paragraph_topography">
        <em>Kronos</em> is a Titan in Ancient Greek mythology who eats his own
        children and represents sequential time. I perceive chronology as a
        shared and external yardstick, which lets you meet a friend at the foot
        of a tower, say, exactly at noon.<br /><br />The rhythm and repetition
        implied by the notion of <em>kronos </em>undoubtedly exist in nature:
        the motion of celestial objects, sleeping and waking up, seasons, the
        month, the day. We call this time linear, but it is also evidently
        periodic. A year comes, then a year after that: if we didn’t number
        them, would we fall into a loop? <br /><br />Then again the world, just
        like us, has an end; one to which it moves closer and closer with each
        passing year. The number of years is therefore also not a mere
        construct. It is a continuous progression through repetition like
        turning wheels, which carry the car along the road. <br /><br />So it is
        real, <em>kronos</em>, like a giant clock hung above the sky, and I like
        it because it gives us synchronicity and unites us this way.
        <br /><br /><em>Kronos</em> was the word Ancient Greeks used to
        designate time, but it wasn’t the only one: there was also
        <em>kairos</em>. <em>Kairos</em> means weather in modern Greek, but it
        is still the word they use for time when they say, for example, “It’s
        time for me to leave”. <em>Kairos</em> takes into account the
        singularity of each moment like beads broken free from the chain of
        chronology. It is defined as the opportune moment to act: now is the
        time to release the arrow, now is the time to rise, now is the time to
        confess. <br /><br />
        <em>Kairos</em> seems to me to be some inner measure that comes from the
        wisdom of how to live. It is an answer and a contribution to the world;
        it is your waters into its majestic river.
      </p>

      <img src="images/topography/5.jpg" alt="image_topographyoftime" />
      <h1 class="title_topography">Time</h1>
      <p class="paragraph_topography">
        Just like we don’t see the rule but we see the apple fall, is time
        something that we don’t see but is as fundamental to life as gravity?
        Then what do we see as its manifestations? What is in this world that
        comes from the heart of time; is not time itself, but is
        <em>of</em> it?<br /><br />
        Let’s think of sheet music: all notes are there on paper, existing
        simultaneously. But to hear the piece, one must play the notes one after
        the other. This is the way how we, humans, perceive music. In the same
        sense, time could be a method in which we perceive reality. What other
        methods could there be? Can one trace the score with her eyes and feel
        the music all at once? Or as Rabindranath Tagore says, a butterfly would
        simply eat the paper and that would be how <em>it </em>understands the
        music. But <em>we</em> comprehend things when they are put into
        narratives and presented sequentially: take stories, career paths, life
        itself with birth and death as its tremendous beginning and end. So, is
        chronology central to us after all? Is linearity not to be held in
        disrespect?
      </p>

      <img src="images/topography/6.jpg" alt="image_topographyoftime" />
      <h1 class="title_topography">Time and Freedom</h1>
      <p class="paragraph_topography">
        For a few months a few years ago, I used to wake up very early in the
        morning and read <em>War and Peace</em>. Tolstoy doesn’t seem to believe
        in free will and makes fun of Napoleon and the Russian general Kutuzov
        for buying into the illusion that they can make anything happen. What
        they actually do, especially in times of war - as far as Tolstoy is
        concerned - is claim existing situations as the outcome of their own
        decisions. What happens happens like in the progression of a giant
        machine or the temperaments of an ocean. Tolstoy was a firm believer in
        historical determinism.<br /><br />Ironically, I felt both very much in
        control and completely free those mornings when I woke up around five or
        six to read. Yes, I understand that my actions, even if not predestined,
        are completely contingent: the sun is unveiled and I move my chair a
        little to the right or a little to the left. But this is normal, since I
        am a unit among others. It is only understandable that my actions depend
        on the position of the sun, the hour my bus arrives at the station, a
        sentence my mother says, or the coming of spring. <br /><br />A more
        disturbing hegemony than that of the sun finds the form of an employer,
        to whom I hand over my freedom for the working day to decide what I do,
        when I go to lunch, when I come to work and when I leave. In my case, my
        employer has decided I leave at 17:30 - a twelve-hour rupture from the
        freedom of my mornings with <em>War and Peace</em>. Or it would be, if
        we ever really left work, if the rest of one working day was in fact not
        a recuperation to be able to serve the next.<br /><br />Why is it, that
        we use “free” as an adjective to indicate having time, and say, for
        example, <em>Are you free tomorrow</em>? What is it that makes us unfree
        when our time is taken from us, or is tied up to a particular task - are
        we still not free if that task is of our own choosing, our own
        aspiration? Or is having one’s time to oneself connected with freedom?
        “Time be thine,” was a farewell for the characters of Shakespeare. What
        a confidence, what a wish. Time be mine! <br /><br />Let me ask: but
        isn’t freedom an essential thing? Is a free being not always free?
        Always, in captivity as well as in workplace? <br /><br />Or is freedom
        an action?
      </p>

      <img src="images/topography/7.jpg" alt="image_topographyoftime" />
      <h1 class="title_topography">Waking Up</h1>
      <p class="paragraph_topography">
        I believe that waking up is the closest thing to being born, but of
        one’s own free will. By waking up one re-enters the chronology, the
        sphere of common time. There, inside this time, are our contemporaries.
        These are the people we hold responsible for all present adversity; and
        this is true, since there is no one else. But for the same reason, they
        may well be the most invaluable of all beings: those with whom we share
        an intimacy, and a destiny, of having met here. <br /><br />One of the
        most prominent traits of despair is that one doesn’t want to get out of
        bed. Why? Perhaps because it is not easy to step back onto unconducive
        land. A dignified life requires coherence between speech, act, and
        truth; but the prevailing method is imitation of false success.
        Appalled, one succumbs to inertia. <br /><br />Courage comes from the
        Latin root <em>cor</em>, meaning heart. An ancient definition of courage
        was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart. Waking up
        willingly is an act of courage; it is a way of saying “Yes, today I want
        to live again.”<br /><br />But there is one more step, one more itch.
        The courage to live is so hard to gain that when we gain it, we seem to
        celebrate it for its own sake. But with what to fill life after that?
        Once the courage to live is there, how to live? What should be the
        content of life, its essence?
      </p>

      <img src="images/topography/8.jpg" alt="image_topographyoftime" />
      <h1 class="title_topography">Mortality</h1>
      <p class="paragraph_topography">
        The light from the day I was born has yet to reach a planet thirty
        lightyears from the earth. The poet Ethel Adnan says that we live “in
        immortality’s split seasons”. I think of mortal lives as heads above the
        water: taking a breath, diving back. But isn’t this tremendous? I read a
        poem that went like this:<br />‍<br />‍<em
          >even in paradise <br />all I could think of <br />was the earth.
          <br />‍<br />‍</em
        >There is a scene in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, where a young
        shepherd is squirming in anguish: he is choking, a black snake coiled
        around his neck. Zarathustra, seeing this view, tries to help; but fails
        to tear the snake away from the shepherd’s throat. Only one thing
        remains to be done. “Bite the head off! Bite it off!” he cries
        hysterically to the young shepherd. The shepherd bites off the snake’s
        head and spits it out, jumping back on his feet, laughing like crazy,
        completely transformed. <br /><br />This is the joy of breaking the
        eternal return - the cycle in which everything will come again, forever.
        Could mortality be the cause of such joy? <br /><br />Would you repeat
        your life as it is?
      </p>

      <h1 class="title_topography">The Eternal Return</h1>
      <p class="paragraph_topography">
        Long mute to me – silence them all – silence the grand – silence to know
        – silence the form – the hue – the call – silence the final – silence
        insurance – resemblance – the flat way of time – silence –
        <br /><br />In their dust a ripe absence sprout – I took the first bone
        of being in my hand – it was as me – motion inbent, holds own arm – far
        from all sculptors – my bone and I – as we happened – faithful and odd –
        gazed at the other with unformed eyes – gazed in fear of losing sight –
        in a purest breath – wide, wide a season – the joy of our birth – a
        wriggle of itself – in breeze – without scope – opened like a bold fruit
        – we rose above time – there was nothing – an eternal flight, a flight –
        the ultimate – the First! – we are ever – to remain in the wind – the
        heard – the dust – the flaw – of nothing – again – again – again – again
        – swashed and hauled by perpetuity – we will – come – the two of us –
        again – !
      </p>

      <img src="images/topography/10.jpg" alt="image_topographyoftime" />
      <h1 class="title_topography">Simultaneity</h1>
      <p class="paragraph_topography">
        The greater whole which we make up must have a character, a life. This
        must be the thing we all partake of with our smaller lives. How else
        would I possibly feel my connection to it so poignantly?
        <br /><br />Think of air, for instance, that runs out of trees, into my
        lungs, back to other flesh, from the oceans to the sky, and then to rain
        and smoke; almost as if we were cells to a body, and it was a connecting
        fluid, like blood. <br /><br />If this first connection were horizontal,
        then there is another one we could call vertical. The philosopher
        Schelling wrote that, since we are creatures unfolding through time, we
        are, just by being, in an unmediated relationship with the most ancient
        past itself. My smallest particles were formed in explosions in the
        early universe and are older than the earth. I already existed piece by
        piece, and took this form after billions of years. Now I carry memory
        and evolution in my body; I bear within me the ability of the world to
        think about and know itself. Could we say, then, that the world has no
        intelligence of its own? Could we say it doesn’t live, when we, as alive
        as hell, are its components? How can the sum of so many lives end up
        becoming lifeless - no, that is not possible.<br /><br />If all time is
        guarded within us, and if we are bound to the undivided physicality by
        virtue of our breath, if by nothing else, we must be both the entire
        being itself, and also, tokens of simultaneity. <br /><br />But time is
        not only part of our substance, it is also a topography distorted by
        events. I remember how, one week left to my university entrance exams, I
        saw the time ahead of me as a mountain to surpass. That week was built
        of tissues so fundamentally different from a week that I would spend,
        say, by the sea. Or think of falling in love, or having a sudden
        revelation. Aren’t they moments of finding someone or something at the
        exact location where you are on ever-present time? Is this what
        <em>kairos </em>is? <br /><br />I wonder if death belongs to the same
        topography. I wonder if it is also a distortion, shaped like… a garden?
        an alcove? a sinkhole? When I think of death, its most defining
        characteristic seems to be its irreversibility. It reminds me of other
        irreversible things, like time and entropy. Increasing complexity might
        be inherent not only to literature, but also to life itself.<br /><br />It
        is inevitable that one day I will leave this spectacle. My body will
        dissolve, become a thing, and find a million siblings. <br /><br />But
        that doesn’t happen now. Now I must live. I must navigate my way at a
        scale between the universe and the atom, a scale that precisely overlaps
        with me. So I return to being human with everything it is made up of; I
        return to art, to philosophy, to science, to language, to culture, to
        oblivion, to anxiety, to the void: I return. Here I am. What now?<br /><br />
