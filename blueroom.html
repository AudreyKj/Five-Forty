      <p class="text_blueroom">The woman named Llane opened her eyes<br />Same as she did every day by God <br />This time to find a peculiar sight: <br /> Her whole bedroom was bathing in Blue light. <br /> An aquarium seemed to
        have <br />
        Materialized
        on the wall opposite her <br /> Bed, taking up the entirety of the space <br />Underneath the Clock.
        A dozen fish (or more) <br /> Swam round and round inside, some pointing <br /> A disinterested, glassy eye in her direction; <br />Llane stared back. How odd!<br /><br />What else, what else was there? Let us see.<br />At first glance, the
        place
        she was in seemed<br />Reasonably similar to her earthly bedroom <br />(Massive aquariums aside, of course.)<br />Mother’s self-portrait, the pale aquarelle<br />She’d finished before killing herself, hung<br />Faithfully on the left
        wall.<br />
        The pretty Chinese lantern Llane found at <br />Some yardsale years ago, dangled <br /> Gently from the ceiling. And here was<br />Her cup of tea on the bedside table<br />Green tea, full of wet leaves, smelling<br />Funny.This looked all
        right,
        Ma’am, <br />All in order, nothing to see down here.<br /><br />
        Except there was, of course, there was <br /> So much to see. Hard to tell, but there <br /> Was something, more than something,<br /> Really. The walls changed and trembled <br /> And sighed, heights and proportions <br /> All over the
        place.
        Dear! How absurd! <br /> Was this place small, or high? Was it <br /> Dark or light? It couldn’t seem, alas,<br /> To make up its damn mind.<br />“What time is it?”<br /><br />Hard to say, really: the hands of the <br />Clock weren’t
        moving,
        and
        besides,
        <br />They were illegible. How upsetting! <br />Llane searched for the Calendar,<br />But woe is me, it was empty: an ocean <br />Of white, lacking any conceivable <br /> Activity. Structure, design and stillness <br /> Were gone all at
        once,
        adieu! <br />Dear me, I understand, she thought,<br /> And her stomach hurt, and what <br /> A funny little bundle of nerves! <br /> I have awakened, it would seem, in <br /> An empty time slot. This strange <br /> No man’s land between
        night
        and
        <br />
        Day, where nothing happens, nothing <br /> Can be done, yet sleep is out of reach. <br /> Only the mind remains, and the mind, <br /> My dear, the mind is quite mad indeed.<br /> Heavens, what shall I do? Alas, there is <br /> No exit: only
        suffer my way to sunrise <br /> Pray this Blue Room goes easy on me. <br /> Shall we?
        <br /><br />But no! It was starting already, the <br />Madness.The Chinese lantern had <br />Morphed into something else: a small girl<br />A doll, string wrapped around her neck.<br />Her eyes were big and black. Why am I
        <br />Here,
        she seemed to ask, reproachfully. <br />Why did you bring me here. Why am I <br />Dead.“Oh no,” Llane said, or cried.“It’s <br />Not you, Mama. Go away. I don’t want<br />To think of you that way. It wasn’t my<br />Fault. I didn’t
        kill
        you,
        no,
        it wasn’t me.”<br />No, the doll replied, no, but it’s your fault<br />For not being there with me, that day, or<br />Any other day, really. <br /><br />Llane looked the other way, but <br />The Other Way was full of things <br />One
        could
        never
        ask for.There were<br />Women inside the aquarium. They <br />Were blue, too. (Of course!) Llane <br />Willed them away, to no avail. <br />Demons! Ignore them, <br />She thought, move back. But<br />The only way back was down into
        the<br />Memory lane of blue joys and failures<br />Down into the fantasies, endless stories<br />Tales Mama used to tell, fables Llane<br />Wanted to write but never did. Why<br />Didn’t we? Lack of time, perhaps. <br />Probably.
        We’ve
        had
        so
        much to do<br />And have so much more on our hands.<br />Life is hard, is it not? Is it my fault?<br />Stop staring at me.<br />“What time is it?” <br /><br />This place is killing me, it is, truly.<br />If only I could wake up, reach the
        sunrise <br />Start to labor like a good working bee.<br />Where is Mama? Is she still there? No<br />There’s a blue
        woman, again.
        Dangling<br />Gently from the ceiling. Who is she?<br />Who are these women? They are closer<br />Where are their eyes? I cannot see.<br />The room is dark and filled with smoke <br />The floor is wet and the air is warm:
        <br />Indeed, it
        would
        appear the Blue Room<br />Is now a Blue Turkish Bath.<br /><br /></p>

        <br /><br />There are women, blue women all around.<br />How many? Hard to tell, really.<br />Five or twenty or a thousand, it doesn’t matter<br />It’s all the same. Their eyes are
        all
        wrong<br />They are all dead. Llane would like to scream<br />But she cannot scream, just sit there and take <br />It all as her mind is melting, take in her own <br />Blue sweat and blood, the blue ghosts of her <br />Regrets and
        blue
        thorns
        of
        past nightmares. <br />Let me out, she sobs, but wait, what is this?<br />What is this sound?<br /><br />
        Here it is, ringing with the strength of ages,<br />This wonder called Alarm clock. <br />It is time! Morning is here <br />A
        glorious
        new
        day and new activities.<br /> “Thank you, oh, thank you!”<br />The hands of the Clock are moving, and <br />She can read: her sight has been restored, <br />Her sanity along with it. Everything is still<br />The walls are white, the
        Calendar
        is
        full<br />The day is planned. Nothing can go wrong<br />Anymore, nothing can surprise or shock<br />Or delight: no colors and fears and small dolls <br />Can interfere with the perfect blandness <br />Of her agenda, the lifeless.
        Llane
        gets
        up,
        still<br />Weeping, looks around, looks at the <br />Chinese lantern, and she’s afraid: but <br />She shouldn’t worry, because there is<br />Nothing, really. It isn’t moving.
        <br /><br />It isn’t moving at all.
